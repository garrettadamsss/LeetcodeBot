# LeetcodeBot

The leetcode bot is a discord bot to be used to request random leetcode problems and send daily leetcode challenge problems. The goal of this project is to provide a more fun method of practicing leetcode problems. 

Webscraper built from cheerio and puppeteer is used to scrape for all free leetcode problems and store them in csv. 

The daily leetcode problem will output a random problem daily and allow users to submit their score. At the end of every day the scores will be counted and anouncement will be made to the winner(s). 

The leetcode bot was created using Node.js and discord.js module. The bot is currently hosted on an EC2 instance.
